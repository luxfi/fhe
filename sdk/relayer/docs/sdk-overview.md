# Relayer SDK

**Welcome to the Relayer SDK Docs.**

This section provides an overview of the key features of LuxFHE’s FHEVM Relayer JavaScript SDK.
The SDK lets you interact with FHEVM smart contracts without dealing directly with the [Gateway Chain](https://docs.luxfhe.io/protocol/protocol/overview/gateway).

With the Relayer, FHEVM clients only need a wallet on the FHEVM host chain. All interactions with the Gateway chain are handled through HTTP calls to LuxFHE's Relayer, which pays for it on the Gateway chain.

## Where to go next

If you’re new to the LuxFHE Protocol, start with the [Litepaper](https://docs.luxfhe.io/protocol/luxfhe-protocol-litepaper) or the [Protocol Overview](https://docs.luxfhe.io/protocol) to understand the foundations.

Otherwise:

🟨 Go to [**Setup guide**](initialization.md) to learn how to configure the Relayer SDK for your project.

🟨 Go to [**Input registration**](input.md) to see how to register new encrypted inputs for your smart contracts.

🟨 Go to [**User decryption**](user-decryption.md) to enable users to decrypt data with their own keys, once permissions have been granted via Access Control List(ACL).

🟨 Go to [**Public decryption**](public-decryption.md) to learn how to decrypt outputs that are publicly accessible via HTTP.

🟨 Go to [**Solidity ACL Guide**](https://docs.luxfhe.io/protocol/solidity-guides/smart-contract/acl) for more detailed instructions about access control.
